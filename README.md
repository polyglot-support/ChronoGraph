# ChronoGraph

**ChronoGraph** is a powerful tool designed for advanced graph-based data structures, optimized for recursive operations and temporal navigation. Built with WebAssembly at its core, ChronoGraph supports distributed hash tables, consistent hashing, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and a unique overlayed bi-temporal DAG structure. The tool also incorporates a 4x temporal "shuttle" mechanism for precise non-temporal optimization, making it versatile for a wide range of applications.

## Key Features

- **Recursive WebAssembly Component:** ChronoGraph is built as a highly efficient WebAssembly module, allowing it to be embedded in various environments, from web browsers to server-side applications.
- **Multi-Graph Support:** Seamlessly work with distributed hash tables, consistent hashes, DAGs, and complex temporal structures.
- **Bi-Temporal DAG Overlay:** Overlay and manage dual temporal dimensions within your graph structures.
- **Temporal Shuttle Optimization:** Leverage a 4x temporal shuttle system for advanced, non-temporal optimization.
- **Self-Referential State:** ChronoGraphâ€™s configuration and navigation states are self-referential, providing a unique meta-layer of interaction that enhances flexibility and adaptability.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chronograph.git
cd chronograph
npm install
```

Or if you're using it in a WebAssembly environment:

```bash
npm install @yourusername/chronograph
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```javascript
import { ChronoGraph } from '@yourusername/chronograph';

// Initialize ChronoGraph
const chronoGraph = new ChronoGraph({
    // Example configuration using self-referential state data
    initialState: {
        node: "root",
        references: {
            "root": { linkedNode: "child1", timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" },
            "child1": { linkedNode: "root", timestamp: "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z" }
        }
    }
});

// Example operation: Adding a new node with temporal overlay
chronoGraph.addNode("child2", {
    linkedNode: "root",
    timestamp: "2024-01-03T00:00:00Z"
});

// Navigating through the graph using the temporal shuttle
const result = chronoGraph.navigate({
    startNode: "root",
    direction: "forward",
    temporalLayers: 4 // Using the 4x temporal shuttle
});

console.log(result);
```

### Advanced Usage

ChronoGraph's recursive nature allows it to be embedded and re-used within larger systems, whether as a standalone component or as part of a distributed network. The self-referential state data mechanism makes it especially powerful in dynamic and evolving environments, where the graph structure can adjust and reconfigure itself based on internal references.

```javascript
// Example: Recursive embedding of ChronoGraph in another system
import { AnotherSystem } from 'another-system';
import { ChronoGraph } from '@yourusername/chronograph';

const system = new AnotherSystem({
    chronoGraph: new ChronoGraph({
        initialState: {
            // Complex, self-referential configuration
        }
    })
});

system.run();
```
